### 1. Project Planning and Requirements:

#### 1.1 Scope Definition:
   - **Objective:** Develop a SaaS platform for matching scholarships with students based on various criteria, utilizing GPT-4 for intelligent matching.
   - **Timelines:** [Specify project start date, end date, and key milestone dates.]
   - **Major Deliverables:** Functional web application, mobile-responsive design, GPT-4 integration, database of scholarships, user notification system, premium features.

#### 1.2 Stakeholder Identification:
   - Primary stakeholders include students, educational institutions, scholarship boards, and internal development team.

#### 1.3 Legal Considerations:
   - Compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
   - Secure handling of personal user data.
   - Respect website terms of service during data scraping.

### 2. System Design:

#### 2.1 Database Design:
   - **Schema:** User profiles, scholarship details, user preferences, matched scholarships, notification settings, webinar details.
   - **Technology:** [Choose a database system compatible with structured data and capable of efficient querying, e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB.]

#### 2.2 API Integration Plan:
   - Detailed documentation study of GPT-4 API.
   - Development of a robust and secure system for API calls and handling responses.

Understood, it's important to delineate the specific features of the application from the development modules that will enable these features. Below, I reorganize the development section accordingly:

#### 2.3 Application lifecycle thoughts

1. Scholarship Link Collection:

- Maintain a regularly updated list of URLs from which scholarship information will be scraped. This list can be stored in a database and should be easily modifiable as sources change, increase, or become deprecated.

2. Scheduled Scraping:

- Implement a cron job or use a scheduler (like Go’s `time.Ticker` or a package like `robfig/cron`) to initiate scraping processes at specific times, preferably during low-traffic hours (e.g., midnight) to minimize the load on both the source websites and your own system.

3. Concurrent Scraping with Goroutines:

- For each URL in your list, launch a goroutine to perform the web scraping. This promotes efficiency and time savings, as multiple sites can be scraped simultaneously.
- Utilize proper error handling and recovery to ensure that your goroutines are robust against unexpected issues (e.g., a website being down).

4. Data Queue and Processing:

- As each goroutine retrieves data, have it send the data to a centralized processing queue. This can be implemented using channels, providing a thread-safe way to organize the incoming data.
- This queue will then batch the scraped data and prepare it for processing, which includes interacting with the GPT-4 API for scholarship matching.

5. Interaction with GPT-4 API:

- The processing queue sends the necessary data to the GPT-4 API, which will analyze the scholarship information and match it against predefined criteria or user requirements.
- Be mindful of any rate limits or quotas from the GPT-4 API and handle potential errors or retries gracefully.

6. Post-Processing Actions:

- After data is processed and returned from the GPT-4 API, the system should categorize the scholarships, calculate confidence scores, and then either update the existing records or insert new records into the database.
- Ensure that this step includes robust data validation and cleaning to maintain database integrity.

7. User Notifications and Updates:

- Based on user preferences and notification settings, trigger actions such as sending out email notifications, SMS, or in-app messages about new or updated scholarships.
- Consider batch processing of notifications to reduce the strain on your servers and to prevent spamming users.

8. Monitoring and Logging:

- Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring to track the success of the scrapes, the health of the goroutines, the status of the processing queue, and the responses from the GPT-4 API.
- Regularly review logs and monitor system health to catch and troubleshoot issues early, preventing disruptions in the service.

9. Continuous Improvement:

- Periodically review the system’s performance and make necessary adjustments to the scraping, processing, or notification algorithms to improve accuracy, efficiency, or user satisfaction.
- Keep an eye on user feedback and usage patterns to continually refine both the backend processing and the frontend user experience.

### 3. Development:

#### 3.1 Development Modules:

##### Web Scraping Module:
- Develop scripts to extract data from designated scholarship websites.
- Ensure scripts are capable of identifying diverse criteria like academic merit, financial need, etc.
- Schedule routine updates to keep scholarship data current.

##### Data Processing Module:
- Establish ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes for data integrity.
- Create algorithms for normalizing and standardizing data.
- Organize data in the database for efficient retrieval and matching.

##### GPT-4 Integration Module:
- Develop an interface for secure communication with the GPT-4 API.
- Create dynamic templates for prompts based on user input.
- Design logic to parse GPT-4 responses into application outputs.

##### User Interface Module:
- Design a user-friendly interface for inputting requirements and preferences.
- Create a dashboard to display matched scholarships, including sorting and filtering capabilities.

##### Notification System Module:
- Develop a backend system to handle user notifications, allowing for customization of notification settings.

##### Testing Module:
- Implement comprehensive testing protocols, including unit, integration, and stress testing.

#### 3.2 Application Features:

##### Freemium Features:
- User-defined scholarship criteria input: Users can specify their requirements for scholarships.
- Matched scholarships dashboard: A list of scholarships, sorted by relevance and accompanied by confidence scores, is generated based on user criteria.
